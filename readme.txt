Allocate people to roles at scheduled events.  
Who does what - where and when?

== Description ==

The plugin is used by embedding shortcodes into your page.  
There are 5 setup shortcodes and one for the finished display.  
These shortcodes are referred to as Role, People, Location, Event, Schedule and View.  

The set of shortcodes all work together in groups to enable multiple, independent schedules to be defined, each with their own people, roles, events.
